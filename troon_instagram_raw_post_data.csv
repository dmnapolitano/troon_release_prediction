The brewery will be open at 11:30am December 10th for merch if you are so inclined. We will have 50 anniversary hoodies and 50 anniversary shirts courtesy of our dude @bosssdog, the burning Troon teku pictured last week (1pp), and this very special 1 year, 16oz Willi Becher (2pp). They say the reaper never takes a vacation but thanks to a fully loaded crowler helmet equipped with our patent pending and ultra-convenient viewing panels you can be confident that if well-provisioned, no death is imminent on Sunday. .

If glasses and clothing aren't your thing then please join us at the same time (11:30am) @brickfarmtavern for a special release of some vintage kegs we've been holding on to. We're still tasting through all of the kegs we've set aside but the full taplist will be posted Sunday morning just in case none of it piques your interest and you want to save money on that all too precious gas. .

Whence it Came, 11.5%- Just about this time two years ago, when @thereferendbierblendery and Troon were merely paperwork buried on someone's desk at the ABC, James and I met up to commiserate about how slow the application process was going. In our distracted state we mistakenly had our scale set to ounces instead of grams and ingested WAY too many mushrooms. To combat the effects we figured we ought to drink a bunch of beer but all we had was macro lager. Needless to say our night was spent elbow to elbow at the Referend's urinals (yes, you can fantasize about this you sick fucks). Quotidian and clich√© as it may seem to those who have never taken hallucinogens, in the moment we were fascinated at the almost immediate feedback of having all of this beer, which we acknowledged was a result of hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure and centuries of experimentation, come right back out and be flushed away without a second thought. And just like that, inspiration struck! With Easter looming on the horizon we were already discussing the finer points of resurrection, so why not extend that concept to beer? I grabbed a flashlight and a socket set, James grabbed his best gloves and beakers, and we trekked outside to open the septic manway (pictured above) to snag a sample. We pitched wort into seven different beakers of reclaimed septic and selected the best result. We don't have microscopes or anything but the resultant yeast and bacteria smelled decent so we added it into two oak barrels of what eventually became Whence it Came. Brewed with Rye, hopped gently with Saaz and coolship-cooled in the septic field to really bring it full circle. True outhouse funk on this one, with butthole-puckering acidity. . *Please note that in the interest of transparency, and out of respect for @thereferendbierblendery, this is NOT a fully spontaneous beer.* .",

Take a sip and hold it against your gums, applying pressure with your tongue. Place a warm, wet compress across your eyes and lie down under your favorite tree. Breathe deeply as the skeletal leaves drift down from the branches and slowly accumulate around you until it is so deep that it obscures your corporeal form. Have a trusted friend thread a straw through the foliage and guide it towards your lips. They will then place the remainder of your can on the other side of said straw and you will drink until the roots of the tree break free of the soil and encapsulate you, pulling you into the earth. Your ego will sustain the tree for the next ten years while you rest peacefully. Upon awakening you will be unencumbered by superfluous desires and you can resume life as a truly productive denizen of our planet.",

We have reason to believe that Bumf and Nothingness will not have the same issues, but in the interest of both full transparency and accountability we will halt the sales of both beers until we have time to evaluate their progress. To anyone who received Pull the Plugs that were unsatisfactory please email me at troonbrewing@gmail.com and I will make it right.

Listen... you could gaze at picturesque vistas of towering, glacier-covered mountains jutting from the Earth in a preposterous demonstration of tectonic plate movement, or sail out onto endless emerald colored seas the surface of which is punctuated every so often with a cresting orca or humpback. Hell, you could even walk out of a bar into the midnight dusk and feel like less of a degenerate than you might elsewhere. But nowhere can you find a facsimile of the gorgeous expanses of Newark as you descend through the smog cover, the winding and majestic span of the Parkway and its life-giving, arterial flow of traffic, or the encouraging honks from your peers on the road.

In general, posts like the one I am about to write make me nauseous so if you aren't the sentimental type I caution you to turn back now! .

Troon just turned 6 months old last week and although that's a pretty inconsequential anniversary it nonetheless got me thinking about a whole lot of things, and this beer is a tribute to them. . ""A More Perfect Union"" is a name with multiple meanings. First and foremost it is meant to honor our amazing friends James and Melissa @thereferendbierblendery and their recent marriage. I couldn't think of a more perfect union! Second, this beer is a tribute to an incredible friend of mine without whom Troon would not exist as you know it today, and of course that's Tom. He has filled thousands of growlers by my side over the last 6 months, he taught me everything I know about commercial brewing, and his Palo Santo beer at Triumph, the beer that opened my eyes to this magical ingredient, stuck with me ever since I drank it all those years ago. .

I'm really proud of how this beer turned out and it may be the first recipe I would consider bringing back. Come try it out and let me know what you think!",

We are OPEN on this most beautiful of Saturdays with roughly 400 cans of new beer. 3/pp. .

Neither Pine nor Apple: Discuss, 9.5%- This beer is brewed with lactose and refermented on a ridiculous amount of pineapple (15% of the total volume of the batch to be exact) before being dryhopped with Simcoe lupulin powder and Citra. Contrary to our expectations the pineapple actually clarified this beer and left it with the beautiful, ever so slightly hazy appearance you see above. More beer-like than our previous smoothies, but less IPA than our hoppy beers. What the hell is this thing? We are left with so many questions. .

The genesis of most fruit names is usually intuitive: Kiwis looks like household keys and they're wee in size. Acai was labeled as such to describe the interaction you have the first time you go to the trendy fruit bowl and frozen yogurt spot that opened up in the space where your old deli was. You get the bill, in shock you mutter a feeble protest at what they're charging you and then you sigh in resignation, hand over the money and trudge back to your car. Even obscure ones like Jackfruit (named after its eccentric inventor) and Dragonfruit (impossible to domesticate and only found at the foot of erupting volcanoes) are obvious, but Pineapple surely reigns supreme with its inscrutable provenance. In light of this we humbly pose the following question to you folks in the hope that you can shed light on the issue: Being neither a Pine nor an Apple, what is this mysterious fruit that we so callously threw into our beer?",

He's become a very close friend of ours over the last year so it is with great remorse that we have to wish him farewell at the beginning of February as he embarks on his next journey. In anticipation of that we gave him free rein over this recipe and he decided he wanted a rye-heavy IPA. We are so happy with his decision! He then selected his favorite hops and given how singular this occasion is we decided to make it even more special by adding them in the largest quantities that we've done to date, 8.5#/ bbl. Woah!

This was a special beer that we brewed to ring in the end of 2018 with our very good friends @halfacrebeer and @tiredhandsbrewing.

We then boiled it for four hours, hopping it heavily throughout. Next, we dry hopped it with inordinate amounts of classic American hops, both new and old. I think it represents a lot of common threads that our breweries share, so have fun unweaving it :) .

Also, just a quick note in regards to our Anniversary Party this coming Monday. We want to assure you that we will not be releasing any packaged beer that day, we are simply hosting an event to showcase the beers of the friends we have made in NJ over the past two years, and a few of our kegs that we have saved over that time. We also relish the opportunity it affords us to actually get to share some beers with all of you in lieu of doing it weekly because we don't have a real taproom at the brewery. I hope this clears up any confusion and helps the decision making process for those of you who might only be joining us in the hopes of taking some beer home with you. Sorry to disappoint if so! All details are posted on the Facebook page, and I'll provide a link in our profile here later tonight for those who haven't been able to find it. .

Two Worlds Become One, 10%- Hoppy ale. .

Every so often we feel the desire to break up the routine of our hoppy ales to avoid becoming too recursive/ homogenous. For this iteration we fermented with a blend of one of our house yeasts and a more attenuative and less characterful yeast. It was still hopped at the normal insane rates of our other beers :).",

Brewed in collaboration with our good friends from right around the corner @conclavebrewing, this beer is a confluence of Conclave's artful balancing of different flavors and Troon's propensity for brewing high gravity ales. Our version has a little bit more restrained spice character and lower carbonation to bolster the already thick mouthfeel, but otherwise I think this is a great representation of our two breweries.

Chained to the Bottom of the Ocean, 8.3%- Spelt DIPA. Saturated, sopping and ultimately drowned in hop aroma and taste. .

Hyperbolic Tasting Notes, 7.6%- Close your eyes. You are standing in a field with your most treasured companion. An autumnal breeze raises goosebumps under your flannel. The wind whispers soft suggestions of the coming fall; the pleasant rot of fallen leaves, sticky pine resin... But what's that? Your nostrils flare as a fleeting but most beguiling scent tickles your nasal passage. An animal urge overcomes you. Your back sprouts hair and your hackles raise. You are now on all fours sniffing wildly at the air, trying to detect another thread of that scent. Aha! To the West! You traverse the loamy soil as fast as your flailing limbs can manage. Spittle foams forth from the creases of your lips and you howl in frustration. Weeks pass. Rain is falling softly as you huddle under an ancient oak tree for protection, diffuse light from the moon filtering onto the forest floor around you. Your companion has long since succumbed to starvation, unable to stomach the carrion that you have subsisted on. You know your death is imminent but the pursuit of the smell, the search for that most treasured fruit, eases the pain. That's exactly what this beer smells like. Now regarding the taste...",

Wallace is our newest crew member and as is tradition we let him brew and name a beer as a welcome to the party. This IPA, brewed with insane amounts of wildflower honey and an equally immoderate amount of hops, was his request. It's a really fun beer that takes one of the recipes we were fondest of in the early days of our brewery and nearly doubles the honey and hops. Only a select few are likely to remember the predecessor to this one, so if you're one of those people I hope you enjoy a taste of the past. To everyone else, I think you'll dig it too.",

So... Despite our best efforts to fuck things up we think we did pretty well during our first and second ""canning"" runs and as a result both beers will be available to you this coming Friday during our normal hours of operation. These 32oz cans are the culmination of many months of planning and preparation and they represent what we consider to be the pinnacle of growler packaging. .

To clarify, yes, these are still growlers and we implore you to treat them as such. Until our experiments with can-conditioning still beer are complete we will only be canning previously carbonated beer which will in no way benefit from being kept warm. With this is mind, it warrants mentioning that we now purge every can with c02 before packaging which should markedly improve the quality of the beer vs. previous iterations of our glass growlers. .

Since we are still so new to this method of packaging we are going to start out with smaller runs than we will in the future and rely on you kind folks for feedback to help us improve as we go. Thank you to anyone who read this far and I hope you enjoy this newest evolution of Troon. I will be posting details about the aformentioned beers in a separate post tonight to avoid confusion :)",

Disputation, 9%- Mixed fermentation golden ale. The third beer we ever brewed. This was fermented/ aged in freshly dumped Chardonnay barrels from our friends @albavineyard for a year with one of our favorite strains of Brettanomyces before conditioning in the bottle for an additional year. Bottling date 12/5/2017. This is the least acidic of the three beers. *This beer is highly carbonated so please refrigerate upright for at least 24 hours before opening* .

Disquisition, 8.5%- Dark sour ale. The second beer we ever brewed, and a recipe that I wrote when I was still homebrewing/ dreaming about Troon. It was fermented/ aged in Bourbon barrels for a year with B. Lambicus before spending another year conditioning in bottles. Bottling date 12/2/2017. This is the most acidic of the three beers. *This beer is highly carbonated so please refrigerate upright for at least 24 hours before opening* .

Treatise, 4%- Mixed fermentation grisette. The first beer we ever brewed. We started with a very simple grisette recipe and fermented it in freshly dumped red wine barrels. After fermentation with our mixed culture we racked it into yet more fresh wine barrels and refermented it on gallons of Counoise juice from our friends @unionvillevineyards. It then spent almost a year in bottles conditioning. Bottling date 12/22/2017. *This beer is especially carbonated, and may want to lose a small amount of foam upon opening it, so you might want to have a glass handy after refrigerating for a minimum of 24 hours*",

Defeated, I threw the still-smoldering foot-long pot-pipe on the ground and admitted defeat. But much like the greatest mystics in history, the crystalline cacophony of shattering glass was the catalyst for an epiphany. ""The beer might not be spontaneous, but we still can be!"" I shouted. James patted me on the back and extolled my creativity, I smiled contentedly and then immediately started writing this very recipe on the back of a napkin just like Harry Potter did.

We can't apologize enough for the frustration and I hope you don't hold it against us moving forward. This is uncharted territory for us and we should have prepared better. .

Holy shit have things changed since our last release... I will just get straight to the point and let you know our plan of attack: We are now doing online presales only. At 5pm tonight we will post a link and you will be able to buy 2 cans (there is no option for 1 can at this point to make things easier on us during this transitional period). You will then be able to come grab the cans at the brewery tomorrow, Friday the 20th, between 4:00-7:30pm. Simply drive up to the brewery door with your gov ID displayed (must match name on credit card used to order) and we will give you the cans. No touching, and no need to even get out of your car! This is the best solution we've thought up to prevent unnecessary lines and mitigate risk for all parties. Again, the beer is yours as soon as you checkout so no need to rush over or worry about inventory. We are also not kegging at this point so there is more to go around than ever. .

If you cannot make it here during the listed time period we ask that you please, please do not order cans anyway. We have extremely limited cold storage space and can't hold onto surplus inventory without impeding future canning runs. Also, PLEASE only order once, there are two cans per order. If we see redundant names you won't be getting 4 cans and the refund will be costly for us.
