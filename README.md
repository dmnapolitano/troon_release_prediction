## Background

In a state with [almost 150 craft breweries](https://newjerseycraftbeer.com/new-jersey-breweries/) (roughly one brewery every 70 square miles), beers produced by the [Troon Brewing Company](https://www.instagram.com/troonbrewing/) are considered to be some of the best.  They are also, most likely, one of the smallest, sharing property with [Brick Farm Tavern](https://brickfarmtavern.com/) under the agreement that Troon brews exclusively for them, with whatever BFT doesn't purchase left available for on-site retail.

This arrangement, along with Troon's size, create a few issues for craft beer fans: beer is made available for sale the day it's completed and the time canning wraps up, which not only varies but can be hard to pinpoint exactly.  Availability is announced via Instagram, so if, pre-COVID, one isn't at BFT to pick it up almost immediately, or post-COVID, one doesn't place an order for cans within a second (:warning:) of the announcement...

The goal of this project is collect data surrounding Troon releases scraped from Instagram and to attempt to predict when--date and time--how much, and possibly what type of beer will be released.

Please feel free to explore what's here so far and view the data/features/visualizations.  And please make suggestions and pull requests, of course. :beers:
